## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why the AAA prefix in the plugin name?

Because the plugin needs to measure options being loaded, it benefits from being loaded itself first. As WordPress loads plugins alphabetically, 
starting the name with AAA made sense.

### Do I need to take precautions?

Yes!! Backup your database.


### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/aaa-option-optimizer)
