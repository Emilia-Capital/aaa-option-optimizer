Find and fix bloated autoloaded options slowing down your WordPress database

== Description ==

Every WordPress site loads dozens — sometimes hundreds — of autoloaded
options from the `wp_options` table on every single page request. Many of
those options belong to plugins you removed long ago, or simply don't need
to be autoloaded. The result: a bigger database query, slower page loads,
and wasted server resources.

**Autoload Optimizer** tracks which autoloaded options your site actually
uses, then shows you the ones it doesn't — so you can safely remove them
or turn off autoloading.

== How It Works ==

1. Install the plugin and browse your site normally for a few days.
2. The plugin quietly records which autoloaded options are actually used
   during page rendering.
3. Visit the settings screen to see every autoloaded option that was
   *never* used — and decide what to do with it.

You can **remove** unused options entirely (great for leftover data from
deactivated plugins) or **disable autoloading** for options that exist but
don't need to load on every request. Disabling autoloading is
non-destructive — the option stays in your database, it just won't be
fetched automatically.

== Features ==

- **Automatic usage tracking** — monitors which autoloaded options are
  loaded on every page, on both the front end and in the admin.
- **Bulk actions** — optimize or delete multiple options at once instead
  of one by one.
- **Known-plugin recognition** — identifies which plugin or theme each
  option belongs to, so you know exactly what you're looking at.
- **"All Options" browser** — view and manage every option in your
  `wp_options` table, not just the unused ones.
- **Source filtering** — filter options by their source plugin, theme, or
  WordPress core to quickly find what you need.
- **Safe by design** — disabling autoload is non-destructive. You can
  always re-enable it.
- **Lightweight** — the plugin's own tracking data is stored in a custom
  database table for optimal performance.

== Why the "aaa" Slug? ==

WordPress loads plugins alphabetically. Because this plugin needs to start
tracking options as early as possible, the `aaa-option-optimizer` slug
ensures it loads first. It's not vanity — it's a technical requirement for
accurate measurement.

= Automatic installation =

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins → Add New**.
2. Search for **Autoload Optimizer**.
3. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.
4. Browse your site normally for a few days — or visit every page
   manually if you're in a hurry.
5. Go to **Tools → Option Optimizer** to review and optimize your
   autoloaded options.

= Manual installation =

1. Download the plugin zip file.
2. Upload it via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, or extract it
   to `/wp-content/plugins/aaa-option-optimizer/` via FTP.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu.
4. Follow steps 4–5 above.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin break my site? =

The safest action — disabling autoload — is non-destructive. The option
remains in your database and can still be loaded on demand. Deleting an
option is permanent, so only do that for options you're confident are no
longer needed (e.g., from plugins you've already removed). Always back up
your database before making bulk changes.

= Can I undo changes? =

Disabling autoload can be reversed from the "All Options" tab. Deleting
an option is permanent. If you need it back, you'll need to restore from
a database backup.

= How long should I wait before optimizing? =

A few days of normal browsing is usually enough. If you have a lot of 
visitors, a few hours might even suffice. The goal is to visit every major 
page on your site (front end and admin) so the plugin can record which 
options are actually used. If you're thorough, you can start optimizing 
sooner.

= Does this work with WordPress multisite? =

The plugin currently targets single-site installations. Multisite
compatibility has not been officially tested.

= How do I know which options are safe to remove? =

The plugin identifies the source of each option (which plugin, theme, or
WordPress core). If an option belongs to a plugin you've already
deactivated and removed, it's generally safe to delete. When in doubt,
disable autoloading instead of deleting — it's the safer choice.

= Do I need to take precautions? =

Yes, always back up your database before optimizing. Disabling autoload
is safe and reversible, but deleting options is permanent.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Please use [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/aaa-option-optimizer/)
for bug reports and code suggestions. The WordPress.org support forum
works too for general questions.

= How can I report security issues? =

Through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack
team validates, triages, and handles all security reports.

= How can I add my plugin to the known-plugins list? =

Submit a pull request on GitHub to
[known-plugins.json](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/aaa-option-optimizer/blob/develop/known-plugins/known-plugins.json).

== External services ==

This plugin connects to two external services to identify the source plugins of WordPress options.

= WordPress.org plugin directory (api.wordpress.org) =

When you click "Report" on an option whose source is "Unknown" and choose or type a plugin slug, the plugin queries `https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/{slug}.json` to verify the slug exists and to display the official plugin name for confirmation. Only the slug is sent. The list of installed plugins offered as suggestions in that field is read locally and is never sent anywhere.

WordPress.org terms of service: https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/

= Known-plugins mapping and origin reporting (option-optimizer-api.progressplanner.com) =

**This is off until you opt in.** Once you enable "Keep the known-plugins list up to date automatically" (on the plugin's settings tab, or by agreeing in the Report popover), the plugin fetches an updated list of recognized plugins once a day from `https://option-optimizer-api.progressplanner.com/known-plugins.json`. This lets the plugin identify newly-added plugins as the maintained list grows, without requiring a plugin update. With this request the plugin sends your plugin version and WordPress version, so the maintainers can keep anonymous usage statistics. No site identity is sent. Until you opt in, only the list bundled with the plugin is used and no request is made. The fetch URL can be overridden, or the feature disabled, via the `aaa_option_optimizer_known_plugins_url` filter.

When you submit a "Report origin" form, the plugin sends the option name you reported, the option prefix shown in the form, the wp.org plugin slug you supplied, and your site's hostname to `https://option-optimizer-api.progressplanner.com/submit`. The submission is recorded as a GitHub issue for a maintainer to review and add to the recognized plugins list. The site hostname is hashed before storage and never published. The option name and slug appear in the public GitHub issue. Submissions only happen when you click Submit on the Report form; nothing is sent automatically.

The endpoint is operated by the plugin maintainers. The submission URL can be overridden via the `aaa_option_optimizer_report_url` filter for users who want to disable or redirect the feature.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.0 =

* Add "Report origin" feature: for options whose source plugin is unknown, users can submit the matching wp.org slug to help maintainers expand the recognized plugins list. Submissions land as GitHub issues for maintainer review; no auto-merge.
* The "Report origin" slug field suggests the plugins installed on your site, so the slug can be picked from a list instead of typed. The field still accepts a typed slug or wp.org URL, so options left behind by a plugin that has since been deleted remain reportable. Suggestions are read locally and never sent anywhere.
* "Report origin" also submits the option prefix the plugin appears to use, alongside the option name, so a single report can cover every option sharing that prefix instead of just the one reported. The prefix is prefilled from the option name and can be corrected, or cleared to report only that option.
* Recognized-plugins list can refresh once a day in the background from the maintainers' server, so the list grows for users without requiring plugin updates. This is opt-in: enable it on the settings tab or agree in the Report popover. The refresh sends only your plugin and WordPress version for anonymous statistics; no site identity is sent.

Bugs fixed:

* If you removed autoload from or deleted an option, it'd be removed
  from the table but would be back when you paginated, that's fixed -
  thanks to
  [Jono Alderson](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jonoaldersonwp/)
  for reporting.
